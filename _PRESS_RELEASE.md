# ourstory #

## A collaborative storytelling app for users to create stories together. ##

This app enables users to anonymously author short stories along with other users by chaining together small snippets (<50 words) users write in sequence. The app prompts users with words or story direction ("something good happens") that they can choose to incorporate into their snippet.

## Why? ##

It can be difficult to come up with and write a story by yourself. Or maybe, you don't consider yourself a writer. With ourstory, you can get the creative juices flowing or just try your hand at writing. Contribute to a story anonymously, and in small free flowing snippets. If you find yourself stuck you can utilize the prompts provided by ourstory.

## How to Get Started ##

To get started, just choose a story from the active story list, read it, then if you like - add your own snippet (please do!). You may also start a story yourself by clicking the Begin Story button.
